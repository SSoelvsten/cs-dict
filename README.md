# English-Danish Technical Dictionary for Computer Science

Danish students tend to speak Danglish when discussing computer science in their
native language. This tiny static webpage provides a dictionary to amend this
gap in their vocabulary. Of course, this is in part made as a joke - but, only
in parts...

## Usage

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React
App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app). After having installed
[NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/), you can run the following commands.

- `npm install`

  Install all dependencies, e.g. the React frontend framework.

- `npm start`

  Runs the app in the development mode. Open
  [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser. The
  page will reload if you make edits. You will also see any lint errors in the
  console.

- `npm run build`

  Builds the app for production to the `build` folder. It correctly bundles
  React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.
  The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes. Your app is ready
  to be deployed!

## Contributions

The dictionary is not complete! The scope of this page can also be extended,
e.g. by adding more words and new features. Any contributions or request of any
kind is very welcome, either by opening an
[issue](https://github.com/SSoelvsten/en-dk/issues/new) or a [pull
request](https://github.com/SSoelvsten/en-dk/compare)!
